### ðŸ”¬ About Me

I'm a computational physicist and quantum researcher with deep expertise in spin dynamics, entangled exciton modeling, and numerical methods for quantum systems. I build theory and software that connect foundational quantum science with real-world quantum technologiesâ€”from spin-based qubit control to efficient hybrid DFT simulations.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in quantum compiler development, circuit optimization, and scientific software engineering.

### ðŸ§  Research Highlights

- ðŸ“˜ **JDE Model for Quantum Information**  
  Developed the *JDE model*, a spin-exciton Hamiltonian used to simulate nonadiabatic singlet fission dynamics and entangled quintet states. Published in *Scientific Reports (2020)* and cited in leading spintronics and quantum control work.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Selection Rules via Wigner-Eckart**  
  Derived symmetry-based transition rules that enable deterministic population of EPR-active sublevelsâ€”paving the way for qubit initialization at room temperature.

- âš¡ **Multigrid Method for Hybrid DFT**  
  Co-authored a new multigrid ISDF approach to drastically reduce CPU and memory costs in periodic DFT calculations. Integrated into PySCF extensions.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Simulation-Experiment Synergy**  
  Matched theory with time-resolved EPR spectra in rigid dimers and crystalline systems using custom Redfield dynamics and annealing-based spectral fitting.
